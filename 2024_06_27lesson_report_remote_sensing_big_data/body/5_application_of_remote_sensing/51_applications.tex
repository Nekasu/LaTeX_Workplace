\section{Applications of Agricultural Remote Sensing}

\subsection{Crop Monitoring and Yield Prediction}
Remote sensing technology plays a crucial role in crop monitoring and yield prediction. Through analysis of remote sensing data and model construction, real-time monitoring of crop growth and accurate prediction of crop yield can be achieved. This not only enhances agricultural production efficiency but also provides a scientific basis for agricultural decision-making.

Monitoring Crop Growth Using Remote Sensing Data
Monitoring crop growth is a vital component of precision agriculture. Remote sensing data enables real-time and continuous monitoring of crop growth across large agricultural areas, facilitating assessment of crop health and growth dynamics.

Multispectral and Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
\paragraph*{Multispectral Remote Sensing} utilizes data from multiple spectral bands, especially visible and near-infrared bands, to monitor crop growth. Common multispectral remote sensing data sources include Landsat and Sentinel-2.

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): NDVI, one of the most commonly used vegetation indices, reflects vegetation cover and health. Changes in NDVI over time and space enable monitoring of crop health during growth.

Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI): EVI performs better than NDVI in dense vegetation areas and is more suitable for monitoring the growth status of dense crops.

\paragraph*{Hyperspectral Remote Sensing} utilizes finely segmented spectral bands to capture more subtle spectral characteristics of crops. Hyperspectral data sources include Hyperion and AVIRIS.

Red Edge Position: Hyperspectral data can analyze the spectral characteristics between red and near-infrared bands to assess chlorophyll content and crop growth status.

Combined Spectral Indices: Using hyperspectral data, multiple spectral indices such as NDVI, SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index), MSAVI (Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index), etc., can be constructed to comprehensively evaluate crop health.

\paragraph*{Radar Remote Sensing} uses data from microwave bands to gather information on crops under conditions like cloud cover and nighttime. Common radar data sources include Sentinel-1 and Radarsat.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR): SAR data can monitor crop growth and soil moisture. Analysis of radar backscatter intensity helps assess crop biomass and growth dynamics.

Radar Vegetation Index (RVI): RVI, calculated using radar data, reflects vegetation structure and density.

Building Yield Prediction Models to Assess Crop Yield
Yield prediction is a critical task in agricultural management. By constructing yield prediction models, crop yields can be assessed in advance during the growing season, providing a scientific basis for agricultural decision-making\cite{sahooHyperspectralRemoteSensing2015}.

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

Historical Yield Data: Includes historical records of crop yield, serving as the basis for model training and validation.

\paragraph*{Data Preprocessing} involves atmospheric correction, geometric correction, radiometric calibration, and data fusion to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

Feature Extraction and Selection
Useful features are extracted from preprocessed remote sensing data, including vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI), red edge position, SAR backscatter intensity, combined with meteorological features (temperature, precipitation), and historical yield data to construct a comprehensive feature set.

Model Selection and Training
\paragraph*{Machine Learning Models}
Regression Models: Such as linear regression, ridge regression, LASSO regression, suitable for simple linear relationship yield prediction.

Support Vector Regression (SVR): Utilizing support vector machine regression algorithms, suitable for non-linear relationship yield prediction.

Random Forest Regression (RFR): Based on decision tree ensemble methods, capable of handling complex non-linear relationships, with high prediction accuracy.

Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM): Suitable for time-series data yield prediction, analyzing temporal changes in crop growth to forecast future yields.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Combined with remote sensing image features, using CNN to extract spatial features from images for yield prediction.

Hybrid Models: Combining LSTM and CNN advantages to build hybrid models, considering both temporal sequences and spatial features to improve prediction accuracy.

Model Evaluation and Validation
Evaluate and validate constructed yield prediction models using common evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²), etc.

\paragraph*{Cross-Validation} Evaluate model generalization ability through cross-validation methods to avoid overfitting.

\paragraph*{Independent Validation Set} Use independent validation set data to verify model prediction accuracy and reliability.

Apply trained and validated models to predict crop yields in practical production.

Real-Time Prediction: Use real-time updates of remote sensing and meteorological data to dynamically predict current season crop yields.

Decision Support: Based on prediction results, guide agricultural production decisions such as fertilization, irrigation, and harvest timing to improve agricultural production efficiency.

\subsection{Monitoring and Control of Diseases and Pests}
Diseases and pests pose significant threats to agricultural production. Early detection and precise control of diseases and pests are crucial for ensuring healthy crop growth and increasing agricultural yields. Remote sensing technology combined with ground monitoring data can efficiently and accurately monitor and control diseases and pests over large areas, minimizing environmental impact.

Early Detection of Diseases and Pests Using Remote Sensing Technology
